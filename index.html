            <h2>What is Nuzdex?</h2>

                during a typical nuzlocke run. No <em>random</em> information about the anime, Pokemon Cafe, or side games.          
            </p>
            <p>Nuzdex is also proven to be sweeter than C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>.</p>

            <h2>What generations of Pokemon do you have?</h2>
            <p>
                We try our best to keep up to date with new generations of Pokemon and any changes to data. It may take a little bit, but 
                we try to at least make an effort to stay on top of changes.
